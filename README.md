**SignBridge** is a powerful, bidirectional sign language communication research prototype. It acts as a bridge between signers and non-signers by offering two highly-optimized, real-time translation pipelines.

Whether you want to type with your hands using our smart Sign-to-Text keyboard or translate your voice into sign language concepts, SignBridge processes everything locally with privacy in mind.

## ✨ Key Features

* **🔤 Sign-to-Text Keyboard**: A real-time, conservative alphabet recognizer using a verified MediaPipe + Random Forest pipeline. Includes a 1-second cooldown, custom motion-detection for dynamic letters (`J`, `Z`), and distinct audio feedback.
* **🧠 Smart Autocomplete**: As you sign, a local quantized DistilGPT2 neural model predicts your next words, augmented by Google Web 1T n-gram statistics.
* **🎙️ Voice & Text to Sign**: Speak into your microphone (transcribed locally via Whisper) or type text to generate an ordered sequence of sign concepts. It seamlessly fetches native ASL video clips from online dictionaries, falling back to ASL alphabet cartoon images for spelled letters.
* **✨ Neon UI**: Features a beautiful, responsive frontend that overlays "cool" neon, glowing, and pulsating skeletal keypoints directly over your live camera feed.
* **🔒 100% Local & Private**: No cloud dependencies. All models, from computer vision to Whisper speech recognition, run locally on your machine.

## 🚀 Getting Started (100% Working Setup Guide)

Follow these steps carefully to get SignBridge running locally on your laptop.

### Prerequisites
1. **Python 3.11+**: Make sure Python is installed and added to your system PATH.
2. **Git**: To clone the repository.
3. **FFmpeg** *(Optional but recommended)*: Required if you want to use the Voice-to-Sign microphone feature with Whisper. Download it and add it to your system PATH.

### 1. Clone the Repository
Open your terminal or PowerShell and run:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Hadi-Mostafa/SignBridge.git
cd SignBridge
```

*(Note: If the repository is inside a larger folder, navigate to the `sign_language_translation` directory).*

### 2. Create a Virtual Environment
It is highly recommended to use a virtual environment to avoid dependency conflicts.
```powershell
# Create the virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate it (Windows)
.\venv\Scripts\activate
# Or on Mac/Linux:
# source venv/bin/activate
```

### 3. Install Dependencies
```powershell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Fetch the AI Models
SignBridge uses multiple local models. We provide a script to download and verify them automatically using SHA-256 hashes.
```powershell
python scripts\fetch_models.py

# Verify that all required models loaded successfully
python scripts\doctor.py --load-models
```

*(Optional)* If you want to use the **Voice-to-Sign** feature, download the local Whisper speech model:
```powershell
python scripts\fetch_speech_model.py
```

### 5. Start the Application!
Run the FastAPI backend server:
```powershell
python -m uvicorn backend.main:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000
```

🎉 **You're done!** Open your browser and navigate to: **[http://127.0.0.1:8000](http://127.0.0.1:8000)**

## 🎮 How to Use

### Sign Keyboard (Alphabet Mode)
1. Select **Alphabet Mode** and click **Start Camera** (Allow camera permissions), or click **Import Video** to upload a pre-recorded video to be translated.
2. Present one handshape at a time to the camera (or video). You will see the neon glowing keypoints map to your hand!
3. The letter will lock in, a short tone will play, and the system will wait 1 second before accepting the next letter.
4. Lower your hand to re-arm repeated letters (e.g., spelling "LL").
5. Use the arrow keys or click to select autocomplete suggestions.

### Voice/Text to Sign
1. Navigate to the second page of the app.
2. Type a sentence or click **Start Recording** to speak into your microphone.
3. The system will process your input and display an ordered sequence of sign concepts. It dynamically fetches high-quality native ASL video clips from online dictionaries for translated words. If a word isn't available, it falls back to displaying ASL alphabet cartoon images for each spelled letter.

## 🛠️ Configuration

You can customize the application by setting environment variables before starting the server. Some useful ones include:

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `SIGNBRIDGE_OFFLINE` | `false` | Set to `1` to strictly prevent any runtime downloads. |
| `ALPHABET_MIN_CONFIDENCE` | `0.65` | Adjust how strict the model is before accepting a static letter. |
| `WHISPER_MODEL_SIZE` | `base` | Which local speech-recognition model to use. |

## 🧪 Running Tests
To verify the integrity of your installation and run regression tests:
```powershell
python -m unittest -v
```

## ⚠️ Disclaimer
**SignBridge is an academic research prototype.** It is **not** a certified continuous ASL translator and must **not** be used as a substitute for a qualified human sign language interpreter in legal, medical, or emergency situations. For an in-depth look at our evaluation metrics, domain shifts, and scientific promotion gates, please read the `DIAGNOSTIC_REPORT.md` and `academic_report.md` included in the repository.
